* Support for automated build (Travis-CI_) and code coverage
* Support for automated documentation (ReadTheDocs_)
* ``make`` commands for build, document generation, test, and deployment
* Correct copyright and license for MuSIC and UCSD

Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a Python package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/idekerlab/cookiecutter-cd.git

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there.
* Install the dev requirements into conda or virtualenv environment. (``pip install -r requirements_dev.txt``)
* Test your docs by running ``make docs``
* Edit ``requirements.txt`` and ``setup.py`` files to specify the packages you will need for
  your project and their versions. For more info see the `pip docs for requirements files`_.
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Add the repo to your ReadTheDocs_ account + turn on the ReadTheDocs service hook.
* Create ``~/.pypirc`` file in your home directory and put the following content in it with your PyPi_ and TestPyPi_ account credentials

.. code-block::

    [distutils]
    index-servers=
    pypi
    testpypi

    [testpypi]
    repository:https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
    username = <TEST PYPI USERNAME>
    password = <TEST PYPI PASSWORD>

    [pypi]
    username:<PYPI USERNAME>
    password:<PYPI PASSWORD>

.. warning::

    **DO NOT PUT** ``~/.pypirc`` **in repo, it should be in your home directory
    with only you having read access**

* Release your package to test pypi by running: ``make testrelease``
* Release your package to pypi by running: ``make release``
