Integration testing
=======================

To support integration testing the unit tests in **{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}**
include a parallel set of tests reside in the existing test framework and
can be activated if ``{{ cookiecutter.project_slug|upper }}_INTEGRATION_TEST`` environment
variable is set to any value:

Example variable:

.. code-block::

    export {{ cookiecutter.project_slug|upper }}_INTEGRATION_TEST="true"
    make test
